    "- Gotta add Pitch and Roll. Also keep in mind that you cannot just remove NAs like you did, because you are going to break these 6.4s time-series. Update: removed the drop_na() statement from the data_description_wrangling_bp.Rmd and included `pitch.angle` and `roll.angle`\n",

    "- Gotta think of a way to characterize the error in the model, because whoever wants to include this error in their (e.g. probabilistic) models, need to know the distribution of the error. So if our model has an accuracy of 95%, we know we have a 5% error, but what is the shape of this error? how the hell we get the shape of the error? histomancy?\n",

So It's likely that the Roll feature is not useful because it may be just random data. \n",

    "\n",
    "Participants:\n",

    "    Principal Investigator\n",
    "    Co-advisor\n",
    "    Student\n",

    "Objective: Discuss initial models for decoding accelerometer and magnetometer signals from wearable collars on sheep in Patagonia.\n",
    "1. Datasets and Calibration:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Datasets Reference: The datasets 'Mercedes' and 'Sofi' were mentioned but appear to not be from the exact same location.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Magnetometer Calibration:\n",
    "        There's concern about the magnetometer data varying depending on the location.\n",
    "        Calibrating the magnetometers and accelerometers could give insight into where in the world the device is being used.\n",
    "        Without calibration, an accurate reading of head pitch is not achievable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Gravity Compensation:\n",
    "        Ensure that gravity is subtracted from each accelerometer axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature Engineering and Usefulness:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Head Pitch:\n",
    "        The neural net cannot compute head pitch solely based on the axes due to a missing parameter (either time or location).\n",
    "        It was suggested to include head pitch as it provides valuable information, unlike the VeDBA which might not add new information.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Roll and Gyroscope:\n",
    "        Our devices lack a gyroscope, which is essential to compute 'roll'. This means the roll data might just be random and not useful.\n",
    "        Colin believes the pitch may also require a gyroscope, though without it, an approximation might be possible. However, using the same model in a different location without a gyroscope may be problematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "    VeDBA: Its addition was mentioned, but there's a concern it might be redundant information leading to potential overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Feature Scaling and Normalization:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Concerns with Min-Max Scaling:\n",
    "        We should avoid min-max scaling as there isn't a clear minimum or maximum value.\n",
    "        If min-max scaling is done per split, the scales would vary, leading to inconsistencies between training and test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Feature Normalization:\n",
    "        A difference of 1 order of magnitude or one standard deviation (SD) between features indicates the need for normalization or standardization.\n",
    "        Histograms of features (without differentiating between sheep or behavior) should be plotted to evaluate the magnitude of feature differences.\n",
    "        The neural network is theoretically capable of learning feature scales. However, due to current limitations in optimizers, it's preferable to scale features manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data Preparation and Model Training:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Data Splitting:\n",
    "        It's important to ensure there's no data leakage from the test set to the training set.\n",
    "        When splitting the training set, information from the labels shouldn't be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Label Encoding:\n",
    "        Utilize classic label vectors, e.g., [0, 1, 0, 0] for representing the four behaviors during model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Segmentation and Sequence Length:\n",
    "        Segments of sequences fed into the CNN-Transformer should be consecutive.\n",
    "        While 5 seconds is standard for neural nets, 6.4 seconds was chosen due to limitations of the transformer architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Model Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Confusion Matrix:\n",
    "        Can be used to estimate uncertainties or measurement errors for each behavior. This differs from accuracy.\n",
    "    QQ Plots:\n",
    "        It was suggested to make QQ plots, though the specific purpose is yet to be defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ensure proper calibration of magnetometers and accelerometers.\n",
    "    Subtract gravity from accelerometer data.\n",
    "    Evaluate the necessity and method for feature scaling via histograms.\n",
    "    Reassess data splitting methodology to prevent label information use.\n",
    "    Utilize classic label vectors for model training.\n",
    "    Examine the sequences fed into the CNN-Transformer to ensure consecutiveness.\n",
    "    Investigate the potential use and purpose of QQ plots.\n"

    "Data leakage is a spurious relationship between the independent variables and the target variable that arises as an artifact of the data collection, sampling, or pre-processing strategy. Since the spurious relationship won’t be present in the distribution about which scientific claims are made, leakage usually leads to inflated estimates of model performance.\n",

    "## Taxonomy of data leakage\n",
    "[L1] Lack of clean separation of training and test dataset. If the training dataset is not separated from the test dataset during all pre-processing, modeling and evaluation steps, the model has access to information in the test set before its performance is evaluated. Since the model has access to information from the test set at training time, the model learns relationships between the predictors and the outcome that would not be available in additional data drawn from the distribution of interest. The performance of the model on this data therefore does not reflect how well the model would perform on a new test set drawn from the same distribution of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[L1.1] No test set...\n",
    "m'not our case'\n",
    "\n",
    "[L1.2] Pre-processing on training and test set. Using the entire dataset for any pre-processing steps such as imputation or over/under sampling. For instance, using oversampling before splitting the data into training and test sets leads to an imperfect separation between the training and test sets since data generated using oversampling from the training set will also be present in the test set.\n",
    "m'gotta think about this over/under sampling, are we going to use it? same thing on imputation. We might use weighted loss functions, which seem better in avoiding problems that arise with over/under sampling'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[L1.3] Feature selection on training and test set. Feature selection on the entire dataset results in using information about which feature performs well on the test set to make a decision about which features should be included in the model.\n",
    "m'not important because we are not doing feature selection?'\n",
    "\n",
    "[L1.4] Duplicates in datasets. If a dataset with duplicates is used for the purposes of training and evaluating an ML model, the same data could exist in the training as well as test set.\n",
    "m'we don't have duplicates'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[L2] Model uses features that are not legitimate. If the model has access to features that should not be legitimately available for use in the modeling exercise, this could result in leakage. One instance when this can happen is if a feature is a proxy for the outcome variable (Kaufman et al., 2012). For example, Filho et al. (2021) find that a recent study included the use of anti-hypertensive drugs as a feature for predicting hypertension. Such a feature could lead to leakage because the model would not have access to this information when predicting the health outcome for a new patient. Further, if the fact that a patient uses anti-hypertensive drugs is already known at prediction time, the prediction of hypertension becomes a trivial task.\n",
    "m'not our case, our features (acc and mag) are legitimate'\n",
    "\n",
    "[L3] Test set is not drawn from the distribution of scientific interest. The distribution of data on which the performance of an ML model is evaluated differs from the distribution of data about which the scientific claims are made. The performance of the model on the test set does not correspond to its performance on data drawn from the distribution of scientific interest. \n",
    "m'our distribution of scientific interest is the behaviour of the sheep we recorded, but \n",
    "m'our distribution of scientific interest is the behaviour of the Pilca sheep recorded with collars from February 2019 to December 2019, and the annotated data is of september and december. So I guess we don't have to make a train-test split that leaves some individuals on one split and other individuals in another split, and we don't have to make a temporal split either.\n",
    "Now, if we want to expand the distribution of scientific interest to other sheep, we should do this split that puts some individuals in one side and other individuals in another side. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we add the new data from Rio Manso, we have to rethink how to make the splits. \n",
    "'\n",
    "\n",
    "[L3.1] Temporal leakage. When an ML model is used to make predictions about a future outcome of interest, the test set should not contain any data from a date before the training set. If the test set contains data from before the training set, the model is built using data “from the future” that it should not have access to during training, and can cause leakage.\n",
    "m' I think this is not our case, we are not trying to make a forecast'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[L3.2] Nonindependence between train and test samples. Nonindependence between train and test samples constitutes leakage, unless the scientific claim is about a distribution that has the same dependence structure. In the extreme (but unfortunately common) case, train and test samples come from the same people or units. For example, Oner et al. (2020) find that a recent study on histopathology uses different observations of the same patient in the training and test sets. In this case, the scientific claim is being made about the ability to predict gene mutations in new patients; however, it is evaluated on data from old patients (i.e., data from patients in the training set), leading to a mismatch between the test set distribution and the scientific claim. The train-test split should account for the dependencies in the data to ensure correct performance evaluation. Methods such as ‘block cross validation’ can partition the dataset strategically so that the performance evaluation does not suffer from data leakage and overoptimism (Roberts et al., 2017; Valavi et al., 2021). Handling nonindependence between the training and test sets in general—i.e., without any assumptions about independence in the data—is a hard problem, since we might not know the underlying dependency structure of the task in many cases (Malik, 2020).\n",
    "m'if we don't make the split putting different individuals in different sides, we cannot make the claim that the model can classify behaviours of other sheep, so the model will only be useful for our data. I guess in this case, where a model is only useful within a dataset, the paper would show how to build such model for other researchers to do the same, but it cannot claim that it's a model that other researchers can use' \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[L3.3] Sampling bias in test distribution. Sampling bias in the choice of test dataset can lead to data leakage. One example of sampling bias is spatial bias, which refers to choosing the test data from a geographic location but making claims about model performance in other geographic locations as well. Another example is selection bias, which entails choosing a non-representative subset of the dataset for evaluation. For example, Bone et al. (2015) highlight that in a study on predicting autism using ML models, excluding the data corresponding to borderline cases of autism leads to leakage since the test set is no longer representative of the general population about which claims are made. In addition, borderline cases of autism are often the most tricky to diagnose, so excluding them the evaluation set is likely to lead to overoptimistic results. Cases of leakage due to sampling bias can often be subtle. For example, Zech et al. (2018) find that models for pneumonia prediction trained on images from one hospital do not generalize to images from another hospital due to subtle differences in how images are generated in each hospital.\n",
    "m'we should make sure all the behaviours appear in both training and test datasets.'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'A model may have leakage when the distribution about which the scientific claim is made does not match the distribution from which the evaluation set is drawn. ML models may also suffer from a related, but distinct limitation: the lack of generalization when we try to apply a result about one population to another similar but distinct population. [...]\n",
    "Robustness to distribution shift is an ongoing area of work in ML methods research. Even slight shifts in the target distribution can cause performance estimates to change drastically (Recht et al., 2019). Despite ongoing work to create ML methods that are robust to distribution shift, best practices to deal with distribution shift currently include testing the ML models on the data from the distribution we want to make claims about (Geirhos et al., 2020). In ML-based science, where the aim is to create generalizable knowledge, we should take results that claim to generalize to a different population from the one models were evaluated on with caution.\n",

Note that some models might use hundreds of features. In such cases, it is even more important to reason about the correctness of the features used, since the incorrect use of a single feature in the model can cause leakage. That said, the same argument for why a feature is legitimate can often apply to a whole set of features. For example, for a study using individuals’ location history as a feature vector, the use of the entire vector can be justified together. Note that we do not ask for the researcher to list each feature used in their model. Rather, we ask that the justification provided for the legitimacy of the features used in their model should cover every feature used in their model.\"\n",

If the distribution about which the scientific claims are made is different from the one on which the model is tested, then any claims about the performance of an ML model on the evaluation step fall short. The researcher needs to justify that the test set is drawn from the distribution of scientific interest and there is no selection or sampling bias in the data collection process. This step can help clarify the distribution about which scientific claims are being made and detect temporal leakage.\"\n",

But now thinking it more thoroughly, to do a 80/20 split per sheep, we would need 10 sequences per sheep (8 for training, 2 for testing), because a sequence cannot be split for train/test. \n",

    "If we decide to do a test train split in which all sheep that appear in the test set do not appear in the train test (thus we can generalize the results to other sheep), there's the question of which sheep we should use for training and which sheep we should use for testing. We can write some code that tries all the possible combinations of sheep for training and testing (following something close to 80/20), and then we can use the results to construct some sort of confidence interval or \"observation error\" for the accuracy of the model. So we should write some code that will grab some sheep for testing and some sheep for training in a way that the resulting split is close to 80/20, check the accuracy of the model with those sheep in those splits, and then extend it to all possible combinations of sheep for training and testing. This would avoid that paper that left in out of the testing split some cases that were hard to classify, and thus their results were overoptimistic. \n",
